# Cruisin' USA - Road Trip Calculator

The Roadtrip Cost Calculator is a Python program that calculates the total cost of a road trip, including the cost of food and gas, and divides the total cost by the number of people on the trip to determine the cost per person.

The program prompts the user to input the number of people on the trip, the length of the trip in days, and the daily food and gas costs. It includes input validation loops to ensure that the user enters valid data.

The program then calculates the total food and gas costs, as well as the total trip cost, and divides the trip cost by the number of people to determine the cost per person.

Finally, the program displays the calculated totals and costs per person.

The program is executed by running the main() function.
